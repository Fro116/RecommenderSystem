# RecommenderSystem
This is an anime recommender system based off of MyAnimeList and AniList user ratings. This codebase has been used to train a model on over 700 million user-item interactions spread across over 4 million users. See the notebook in `notebooks/README.ipynb` for usage instructions (you may need to install Python and JupyterLab first).

Details on the model can be found by inspecting the source code at `notebooks/TrainingAlphas`. The main component is a BERT-style transformer that is pretrained on watch histories and fine-tuned on a learning-to-rank task. This model is ensembled with other, more classical, recommender system approaches for minor improvements in offline metrics.

See [Deep Learning for Recommender Systems: A Netflix Case Study](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/18140), [Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf), [Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031.pdf), [Position-Aware ListMLE: A Sequential Learning Process for Ranking](https://auai.org/uai2014/proceedings/individuals/164.pdf), and [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) for references on some of the methods used. Considerable architectural changes are necessary to make full use of the explicit ratings scores, as well as other interaction metadata.

Once the model has been trained, recommendations for a new user can be generated by running `notebooks/RecEgress/RunAllScripts.ipynb`. This will fetch the newest version of a given user's animelist from either MAL or AniList, perform model inference, and output an annotated notebook of the top recommendations for that user.

At some point I'll figure out how frontends work and spin up a website, but until then, the JupyterLab notebook interface will have to do. Sorry.
