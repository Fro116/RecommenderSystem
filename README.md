# RecommenderSystem
This is the backend for an anime recommender system based off of MyAnimeList and AniList user ratings. This codebase has been used to train a model on over 700 million user-item interactions spread across over 4 million users. See the notebook in `notebooks/README.ipynb` for usage instructions (you may need to install Python and JupyterLab first).

Details on the model can be found by inspecting the source code at `notebooks/TrainingAlphas`. A simplified overview is that the model is broken into three subcomponents. The first predicts the probability that a given show will be the next show you'll watch. The second predicts the rating that you'll give a show conditional on having watched it. The third is a pairwise ranking algorithm that takes these inputs, and many others, and creates a ranked list of items that you would enjoy. These items, after some light postprocessing, become your recommendations.

See [Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf), [Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031.pdf), and [BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2618.pdf) for references on how the above subcomponents are created. Note that considerable architectural changes are necessary to make full use of the explicit ratings scores, as well as other interaction metadata.

Once the model has been trained, recommendations for a new user can be generated by running `notebooks/RecEgress/RunAllScripts.ipynb`. This will fetch the newest version of a given user's animelist from either MAL or AniList, perform model inference, and output an annotated notebook of the top recommendations for that user.

At some point I'll figure out how frontends work and spin up a website, but until then, the JupyterLab notebook interface will have to do. Sorry.
